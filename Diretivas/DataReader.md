# Data Reader 

Library that reads the data obtained by
analysing x-ray images and reports of the patients.

## Requirements 
To start using the library, you must download
the clinical readings and the images that you want to 
analyse, and save them in your computer (you will
need the path of them to run the code).
After that, you need to install the repository

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tb-brics/dorothy-data-reader.git
``` 

Doing that, you will have all the requirements to start using 
the library

## Running the library 
First of all, if you want to get information about the images and
clinical readings, you need to import the 'Dataset' corresponding
to the country you want the information from(China, Montgomery, India).

```
from xrayreader import Dataset
```

To get information from a specific dataset, you will need to use the path where the images are stored.
This will show the name of the dataset which you are getting information from, also 
the name of the images and of the clinical readings.

```
data = Dataset(name = 'name of the country you want', path = 'path where the information is stored')
data.get_data()
```

If you want to see if the patient has tb or not, and the report, you can print it.
It will return tha gender, the age, if the patient has not tb(shows False) or
if he has any abnormality(shows True) and, at the end, the report.

```
print(data.getdata()['data']['metadata'][0])
```

## Extending the Library

To add new databases in the library, the first step is:
extend a file within the metadatareader module.
****
This file must have a  ```Reader class``` , which will inherit the functions and methods of
```ReaderBase``` (get_filenames and parse_files - the last one is responsible to store
the patient data -age, gender and report) and will be able to get the data from the clinical
readings and return them into a list.
~~~~
class ReaderBase:
    """
    This class stores the filenames into a list.
    """
    suffix = "*"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        path = kwargs.get("path")
        if path:
            self.folder = os.path.join(path, self.suffix)
        self.filenames = []

    def get_filenames(self):
        """
        Return the name of the file in which the report is stored.
        """
        if self.folder:
            self.filenames = glob.glob(self.folder)
        return self.filenames

    def parse_files(self):
        """
        This function stores patient data(age, gender, report) in a list 'data_china'.
        """
~~~~
Inside of the ```Reader```, functions must be established to handle the specifics of the 
data you want to insert.
****
The next step is to extend a file, now inside of images module.
This file must have a ``` class Reader```, that inherits the methods and functions
set out in ```ReaderBase``` (like 'get_filenames' and 'get_data'). 
Using this, it will be able to get the filenames of the images and return them.
~~~~
class ReaderBase:
    """
    This class stores the filenames into a list.
    """
    suffix = "*"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.folder = None
        path = kwargs.get("path")
        if path:
            self.folder = os.path.join(path, self.suffix)

    def get_filenames(self):
        """
        Return the name of the file in which the report is stored.
        """
        if self.folder:
            filenames = glob.glob(self.folder)
        return filenames

    def get_images(self):
        """
        Returns the name of the files where the images are stored.
        """
        return [Image(filename=f) for f in self.get_filenames()]
~~~~
~~~~
class Reader(ReaderBase):
    """
    Get images from image data set
    """
~~~~
****
After that, it is necessary to create a class inside of data.py, which
will inherit the functions and methods of ```DatasetBase``` and through ```DatasetBaseInterface```
recognize the path used and return the desired data and information from
clinical readings and images.
~~~~
class DatasetBase(DatasetBaseInterface): #pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """
     stores the path where the files are saved
      so that the data can be read.
    """
    dataset = None
    metadata_folder = None
    images_folder = None

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.path = kwargs.get("path")
        self.metadata_path = os.path.join(self.path,
                                          self.metadata_folder)
        self.images_path = os.path.join(self.path,
                                        self.images_folder)

    def get_data(self):
        metadata_reader = importlib.import_module(
                f"xrayreader.metadatareader.{self.dataset}").Reader
        images_reader = importlib.import_module(
                f"xrayreader.images.{self.dataset}").Reader

        data = {"data": {}}
        data['data']['dataset'] = self.dataset
        if self.images_folder:
            data['data']['images'] = images_reader(path=self.images_path).get_images()
        if self.metadata_folder:
            data['data']['metadata'] = metadata_reader(path=self.metadata_path).parse_files()
        return data
~~~~
If the data does not have reports and the information about whether or not the patient
has tb is in the filename of the image, this should be resolved in this dataset.
