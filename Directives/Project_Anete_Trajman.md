## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

<br>

### Title: Computer-aided diagnosis for excluding active tuberculosis in contacts of pulmonary tuberculosis patients: breaking the transmission chain 

**Abstract**  

Despite being preventable and curable, tuberculosis (TB) is still the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent in the world.1 Different strategies to increase TB detection and completion of treatment in the last two decades, which comprises a four drug-regimen for six months, have not allowed attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals targets for TB incidence and mortality decline. The WHO2 and the United Nations3 have now specific targets to eliminate TB until 2050 (End TB Strategy), and TB preventive treatment (TPT) plays a strategic role to attain these targets.4  

Prevention of active TB through treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is a cornerstone for achieving TB elimination.5 LTBI affects about 25% of the world population,6 and those with high risk of progression to active TB, such as patients with immunosuppressive conditions or with recent infection, should be treated. Contacts of patients with active pulmonary TB are the largest existing population targeted for LTBI treatment. The United Nations declaration of 2018 recommends treating, until 2022, 6 million persons living with HIV (PLH), 4 million child contacts and 20 million adult contacts of active TB patients. 7This is not an easy task, because the cascade-of-care of contacts includes multiple steps, from testing LTBI, exclusion of active TB and treatment prescription and adherence. Many losses occur in all steps of this cascade, and less than 20% of those intended to receive TPT complete treatment.8 In Brazil, less that 2% complete TPT.9 

The step of active TB exclusion is a bottleneck in many low- and medium-income countries (LMIC), including Brazil. Currently, WHO and the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommend symptom screening and chest X-rays (CXR). The risk is so high in PLH and children under 5 years of age that WHO recommends that in high-burden countries (all LMIC), this step can be skipped in those two subpopulations. Brazil, however, recommends CXR in all contacts before TPT can be treated. Unavailability of CXR and the need for specialists to interpret the results delay or preclude TB exclusion and the initiation of TPT. Changes in the lung parenchyma due to diseases other than active TB include sequelae of TB (fibrosis, bronchiectasis, cavities, calcifications), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pneumonias, tumors, adenomegalies among others. Several pulmonary images that appear in patients with COVID-19, which recently reached thousands of people on the planet and can affect more than half of the population, even without causing symptoms, can remain as a pulmonary sequel, making the interpretation of RxT even more difficult. Computer-aided applications have been developed to overcome this barrier.11–13

This team has been working on strategies to simplify the cascade of care of contacts and PLH to scale up TPT in LMIC. We have previously worked on a novel serum-based test to exclude TB, that had a high negative predictive value.14 In the current project, we intend to validate one exiting application and develop an application to read CXR of contacts and distinguish (a) normal patterns; (b) parenchymal lesions non-active TB related and (c) active TB lesions. The developed application will be available for free- of-charge incorporation in the Brazilian public health system (SUS). This would allow same day exclusion of active TB and the possibility of TPR prescription. To this end, we will work with a multidisciplinary team that will include specialists on TB, public health and artificial intelligence-specialized engineers. For machine learning, we will use a normal CXR database, from participants of two clinical trials of different regimens to treat LTBI15,16 and publicly available databases of multiple TB and non-TB CXR.

### Problem contextualization, justification and relevance of the proposal for the SUS

It is estimated that 23% of the world population has ILTB. This contingent of about 1.7 billion people is the reservoir of the disease because approximately 10% of them will fall ill between 6 months and 50 years after infection, generating new cases for several decades. Some have a higher risk of becoming ill. PLWH without the use of antiretroviral treatment (ART), for example, have a 10% risk of falling ill every year, at a 10% discount throughout life. Children up to five years old have an immature immune system and are therefore also more vulnerable to illness. People with recent infection are also at high risk.17

Strategies for controlling the TB epidemic include reducing the infection or making people who have acquired the disease, by (1) improving living conditions, that is, less crowding and poverty, (2) detecting and early treatment of patients, (3) vaccines that prevent transmission, which do not yet exist, (4) treatment of immunosuppression (but people with immunosuppression are only a small contingent of the 56 million people with recent infection and high risk of illness ), or (5) the treatment of latent infection (TPT). The effect of each of these strategies on the endemic was assessed in mathematical models.5 A more effective strategy in isolation is TPT, as shown in Figure 1, blue line. The broad timely treatment of the latent and active forms of TB allows, according to this model, to achieve the goals of TB elimination.

![](Aspose.Words.8ebcaaf7-d2bb-42e5-99f1-27dfd220324b.001.png)

Figure 1: Effect of different strategies on the global tuberculosis endemic.5 

For this reason, at the United Nations Organization high-level meeting to eliminate TB, which took place in 2018 in New York, representatives from more than 100 countries pledged to preventively treat 30 million people until 2022: 6 million PLWH people, and 24 million contacts, of which 4 million are under the age of five, the most vulnerable.7  

This is not an easy task: in 2018, TPT was initiated at 1.8 million PLWH, compared to just under 1 million in 2017. However, globally, TPT was initiated in only about 350 thousand contacts with less than 5 years - an increase of 20% compared to 290 thousand in 2017 - representing 23% of the 1.3 million children under 5 estimated as eligible for treatment each year. There has been no progress in the group of contacts over 5 years of age.1 This is due to the multiple barriers in the different stages of care for people eligible for TPT. Less than 19% of TPT candidates complete treatment, and there are losses in all stages of the care cascade, from identification and screening to treatment adherence.8

The greatest losses are in the initial identification stage, almost 30% of the people who should be screened do not undergo any tests.8 Following are the diagnostic steps, which include confirmation of the infection and exclusion of the active disease. In these stages, more losses are added. Finally, the last stages of the cascade comprise prescription, acceptance, and adherence to treatment, with additional losses (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cascade of care of ILTB, with losses in different stages.8 

In Brazil, there are many more losses: among patient contacts, less than 2% do not even start TPT. The reasons for these losses are diverse and different in each country. In Brazil, discredit and ignorance of health professionals is the main one, but there are losses at all stages. In a study in which we tried to overcome these difficulties, 20 RxT for the exclusion of active TB was one of them (Bastos, Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, forthcoming).

The object of the present study refers precisely to the stage of exclusion of active TB. This barrier is so universal that the WHO has, in some situations, dispensed with the exclusion of active TB with RxT. Based on a meta-analysis that showed the high negative predictive value for active TB from the absence of four symptoms (fever, cough, night sweats and weight loss) 21 in PLWH, WHO started to recommend in 2011 that symptom-based screening used for this population. More recently, it was shown that in the subpopulation using ART the negative predictive value was low (51%), and the RxT increased this value considerably (84.6%), 22 but at the expense of reducing specificity. Thus, the post-test probability of having active TB is 69% in the absence of symptoms and 50% in the absence of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.23 Based on this updated systematic review, today the WHO recommends using RxT when accessible in the system but says that the absence of this test should not be an obstacle to TPT, especially in countries with a high burden of TB.4 Regardless of the discussion of exclusion in PLWH and children under 5 years of age, the larger population we need to reach, the 20 million people without HIV infection over 5 years old, still need RxT, 4,24 which in many places is a barrier.

In Brazil, the stage of exclusion of active TB with RxT is not dispensed within any population. Recommendations for HIV-free contacts of any age are the same as the WHO recommendation for HIV-positive contacts over 5 years old, asymptomatic ones should be tested as the tuberculin skin test, if positive, they should do RxT. For PLWH, the Ministry of Health of Brasil recommends that those with CD4 + cells <350 / mm3 should start treatment without further investigation, but the others should follow the flow with tuberculin test and RxT.

The interpretation of RxT requires the presence of a specialist, which slows down the process in many primary care settings. The use of applications that use artificial intelligence techniques based on machine learning (ML, Machine Learning) to aid computer diagnostics is under development, with four already commercialized. The cost-effectiveness ratio of these applications is not established in any health system.

To overcome this barrier, we are proposing the validation of an existing commercial application - never validated for this purpose (asymptomatic contact and PLH assessment) and the development of an open software application for SUS, which allows a quick assessment of RxT and beginning same day of the TPT exam. The developed application will also be validated and made available free of charge to SUS. The application will be developed using artificial intelligence techniques, but precisely deep machine learning (* deep machine learning *).

ML techniques have been successfully applied in different areas of knowledge. In particular, medicine has experienced an intense activity in the development of intelligent systems that support the screening and diagnosis of many important diseases. In the area of ​​health, in particular, intelligent systems need to meet important statistical requirements, so as not to produce trends in their selection, while achieving high levels of efficiency. These systems have a lot to gain when they incorporate expert knowledge in their project, which favors contextual learning and the effectiveness of the solution, in the context of the application.

Scoring systems (* score *) have been developed to support the tracking and diagnosis of TB in different regions and environments, using advanced computational methods. Several TB studies have reported promising results, mainly in terms of sensitivity (81% to 100%), using clinical variables in modeling. These results indicate that computational models can be effectively used in TB screening and diagnosis. Most applications use decision and regression trees and artificial neural networks (ANN). In general, ANN exhibits better performance when compared to other methods, with higher rates in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

RxT presents challenges. As these are a projection of thoracic densities in a single plane, the loss of one dimension increases the challenge of interpretation. However, there are already commercial systems that use machine learning to automate interpretation, obtaining areas on the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics), AUC curves, between 0.81 and 0.99, obtaining accuracy levels of up to 95.6%. Additionally, the results are improved when there is an association with clinical information or a combination of multiple classification systems.

At UFRJ, the Electrical Engineering Program at COPPE, Faculty of Medicine, the Tuberculosis Research Center (CPT), and the Clementina Fraga Filho University Hospital (HUCFF), established multidisciplinary cooperation aimed at TB research using ML. As a result, the NeuralTB system has been developed by the proposing group since the beginning of this century, using MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and SOM (Self-Organizing Map) RNA, applied to patient data. Models for active, paucibacillary, pleural TB, meningitis, and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) were developed, in addition to a score for isolated people in hospitals, which has a high operational cost and for which X-ray information was essential for the model developed, with the identification of risk groups. Recent studies have shown that the RNA approach (NeuralTB) is cost-effective and that it is close enough to the Pareto limit of an ideal screening process to select patients for more complex tests. The research work also addressed the discontinuation of treatment, due to the patient's social difficulties, which is relevant for multidrug-resistant TB.

In recent years, deep learning has proved to be a highly efficient ML paradigm. This model performs the training of very deep models, with several layers of processing that require the adjustment of thousands of parameters. For this, to have sufficient degrees of freedom, it is necessary to use a very voluminous database, which sometimes makes the choice for this type of processing unfeasible. On the other hand, in images, in particular, deep learning has been shown to be state-of-the-art in several practical applications.

In the specific case of radiological images, deep learning also has promising results. In general, the models are of the CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) type, which uses convolution layers to create a more abstract conception of the data, followed by dense layers that use the extracted information to identify sophisticated and subtle patterns for classification purposes. Regarding the use of chest radiography in TB, there are very high classification results, obtaining an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of 0.88–96.37 Another ML paradigm that has stood out in different applications is the use of a committee machine, in which different models are combined to perform the classification task. In this way, a divide-and-conquer strategy is used, in which less complex models are used in a set (ensemble) to perform simpler parts of the task and the complexity of the model is obtained from the combination of these simpler models. The ensemble strategy adapts to different ML technologies and can also be used with deep learning models.

Finally, it should be noted that ML methods are based on available data, so that the quality of these data is of fundamental importance. Additionally, it is about data with quality that one can obtain the information that is intended to be processed and, with this, recognize the patterns of interest, in this case, for screening in LTB. Therefore, the techniques that evaluate data quality (DQ, in English) and, consequently, the quality of information (IQ, in English) have been receiving increasing attention in the areas of data science.

Determining the dimensions of the DQ is one of the essential activities in this area. In general, these dimensions are determined from the processing objective, observing which are the essential elements that determine the current DQ level and which would be the determining factors for a possible DQ improvement action. Thus, interventions can be made in order to improve the DQ.

## Procedures

The application will use ML techniques with an emphasis on deep learning and will be trained to distinguish between radiological lesions of active and non-active TB. For that, we will use the classification in (1) RxT without parenchymal lesion, (2) RxT with sequelae injuries from tuberculosis, pneumonia and other non-tuberculous parenchymal diseases, and (3) parenchymal lesions suggestive of active TB.

The data sets that support the work are available and are summarized in Table 1, including ILTB data and general RxT data, for screening for active TB. The data on active TB are public so that we can develop the system based on the detection of active TB. The learning transfer technique can then be applied, aiming at screening for ILTB, given a large number of images available in public databases. This technique, which is developed from deep learning models, allows new models to be built for bases with a smaller number of samples referring to similar problems, from complex high-performance models (with a high number of parameters to adjust), which are developed from a large number of samples. Thus, for the new application, a trainable layer is introduced for the data of the specific problem to be tackled. In this way, the public base serves both to assess the learning capacity of the techniques understudy for RxT (reference development), as well as allowing a more complex learning system to be developed, which potentially increases its performance. screening, in terms of sensitivity. The learning transfer technique will be compared with simpler models, which use few layers of processing (referred to as shallow models). Artificial neural networks will be used in the experiments, both in its shallow form (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) and in convolutional networks (CNN). <br>

Another form of ML that will be evaluated is also based on deep learning. In this case, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model produces a new training paradigm, using a data generator that seeks to confuse a high-performance classifier system, in the search to produce synthetic data that accompanies the original probability density function, up to a point where the classifier no longer knows whether the data is synthesized or real. This technique is designed based on game theory. Thus, the ILTB data can be synthesized in the GAN model and the synthesized data produced abundantly are used for training the most complex deep model. In this case, all the complexity of the model is adapted to the ILTB data, which are then used for the generalization tests of the model, reducing statistical tendencies of the process. This alternative form also seeks to develop a more complex model, with a high learning capacity, so that the sensitivity reaches high values ​​for the screening of patients in ILTB. Also, in this case, the neural networks used are of the CNN type, both to act as a generator and as a classifier, in the adversarial model of GAN. Training in the GAN paradigm has received great attention from researchers and the GAN that uses Wasserstein distance emerges as one of the best options to stabilize the training process. This distance measures the work (in the physics sense) that needs to be done to move a specific probability density (synthesized data) towards another reference density (real data). Thus, at a minimum of this distance, the training is capable of producing synthetic data that can be considered new samples for the original data.   

The classifier system will be structured in deep learning based on neural networks of the CNN type, which aim to identify the presence of active TB in the screening for the treatment of LTB. Eventually, ensemble models will be used, with each CNN network being a specialist for a given standard for RxT (normal patterns, non-TB-related parenchymal lesions, and active TB lesions). In this type of ensemble (Specialist Class), different modes of fusion of specialist knowledge can be used to obtain a final decision, with the possibility of combining by vote (weighted or not) or using more sophisticated non-linear combining methods, which will also be analyzed. In some previous successful applications, a new CNN merges the information extracted from each expert for the final decision. Techniques that deal with data imbalance, which naturally arise in this type of approach (training data from one class against data from all other classes) will also be applied, aiming at efficient learning.

The deep learning paradigm has ample learning capacity, as its deep layers allow abstracting essential information for the classification task, even in cases of great complexity. However, as with any ML technique, deep learning gains even more processing power when combined with expert learning, which can direct training, optimizing what is really at stake in the LTB screening task. In this way, we will be combining expert knowledge and deep learning, taking advantage of the multidisciplinary composition of the project team (doctors, engineers, computer scientists).

The model will initially be developed with the public base, as a proof of concept. Then, using the knowledge transfer strategies and the GAN paradigm, CNN models will be developed combining real and synthesized ILTB data. Cross-validation techniques will be used to assess the statistical uncertainty regarding the data sets used. Then, the proposed model for ILTB will be validated in a sample that will not be used in the development of the model. In the development of the proposed system, the emphasis on performance will be given to sensitivity, considering the objective of screening in ILTB (which will allow a high negative predictive value, which is what is sought).   

The system to be developed to automate the RxT analysis for screening in LTB will use the open software development paradigm, in such a way that there are no costs embedded by the chosen development platform when it is in operation, also facilitating the maintenance of the system since the entire structure of the system is known and easily upgradeable. In addition, the system will be conceived in a reproducible way, in such a way that the results of this work of development and validation of the system can be replicated by any other research group. In these aspects of reproducibility, we highlight: 

1. Availability of data. Based on an access protocol (license), the data set will be available for new developments and validation of the results of this project;
1. Additionally, this development will also be applied using a public RxT database for screening for sensitive TB, so that the proof of concept of the system can be replicable for those who will not have access to the ILTB data set
1. The software resulting from the project will be created in a “reproducible” way from day 1 - and not at the end of its development. This will allow for better participation of the partners and, at the end of the development, it will be ready for inclusion in scientific publications. This implies that the software will be extensible in nature. Versioning, automation, and other features will also be considered for this purpose.

Concerning data quality, among the different strategies for improving the DQ, we will use the total data quality management model. In this case, our data are from RxT images and we will start processing them by digital imaging of the RxT films, to include these images in the data set of digital images already available. Thus, the DQ analysis will be applied to this new data set. After identifying the essential DQ dimensions for diagnosis in digital X-ray images, interventions to improve the level of quality will use a systems feedback model, in which the intervention is performed and measured to a given objective level, indicating the improvements obtained and what factors are essential (KPI - Key Performance Indicators) to be successful in the intervention. Also, we still have the public bases that will also be used, in such a way that the analysis of DQ will also be made on these bases, following the same approach.

### Database

The ILTB's worldwide database of the lead researcher's clinical teaching consortium has more than six thousand RxT, a good part of which is in digital format. Brazilian and African data will have to be digitized at the beginning of the project. All the RxTs in this bank were considered not to be from people with active TB, as they were randomized to a clinical trial for TPT with two different regimens. In Brazil, more than 1,000 participants were randomized under the responsibility of the principal researcher for the project presented here. Previous work by researchers on the project team showed that digitized images can be read properly, with a high level of agreement with the original reading on film. In terms of public data, two sets of data will be used:

1. NIH chest X-ray (USA): this data set consists of 800 frontal view chest radiographs, of which 394 have manifestations of TB. All images are provided with information on clinical reading, patient's gender, and age. Clinical reading text can be explored with automated text analysis (for example, natural language processing) to provide references regarding spatial location. Besides, 138 images were manually segmented, identifying the lungs, which can be used to test the automatic segmentation of the lungs. This segmentation can improve the classifier's accuracy by limiting the training and operating data space.
2. ChestX-ray: consists of 112,120 chest X-ray images of approximately 30,000 patients. All images were annotated using natural language processing in the radiological reports, which are associated with the patient's gender, age and follow-up number (if any). The notes correspond to non-findings or at least one of the 14 common findings in radiological images: atelectasis, consolidation, infiltration, pneumothorax, edema, emphysema, fibrosis, effusion, Pleural pneumonia, thickening, cardiomegaly, nodule, mass and hernia. The expected accuracy of the image annotation is 90%.

<br>

### Infrastructure

The work will be developed by a multidisciplinary team from UFRJ, UFLA, and UEA, which combines doctors and engineers, with part of the team with a history of collaboration in TB research with the use of artificial intelligence. At UFRJ, the Faculty of Medicine and the Tuberculosis Research Center at Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho collaborate with the Signal Processing Laboratory (LPS) of the Electrical Engineering Program at COPPE / UFRJ, which has been partnering for tuberculosis research for twenty years. LPS has extensive experience in the application of artificial intelligence in health and different areas of knowledge. A group from the Biomedical Engineering Program at COPPE / UFRJ, which has experience in pulmonary models, also participates in this effort. In terms of modeling with artificial intelligence, we also have collaboration with UFLA, based on its experience in automation and health applications. Besides, there will be Swiss participation by the research group Biosignal Processing of IDIAP, which has solid experience in artificial intelligence and which recently started a collaboration with UFRJ in tuberculosis research. Collaborators from South Africa (BRICS) and Canada will also bring important contributions in the areas of TB research and machine learning.

The Signal Processing Laboratory (LPS) of the Electrical Engineering Program at COPPE / UFRJ operates in computational intelligence, stochastic signal processing, and data quality projects, fostering innovation (six startups were formed by COPPE graduates, from projects in the LPS). In addition to bench-top equipment (instrumentation and computational), LPS has a well-equipped processing cluster with servers and GPU cards, which has been updated recently to address the processing requirements that deep learning models require. LPS also has access to COPPE (Lobo Carneiro) and LNCC (Santos Dumont) supercomputers. About 80 students work in the laboratory, at different levels of academic training. LPS has partnerships in different areas (health, defense, oil & gas, experimental physics, different engineering qualifications), with emphasis on the computational intelligence models designed at LPS and which are in operation at the ATLAS Experiment, at CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research). LPS has been collaborating with the Faculty of Medicine and the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital for the development of intelligent models in the area of ​​tuberculosis for twenty years. The laboratories of the Biomedical Engineering Program have computers (including a CUDA multi-core station), instrumentation for respiratory monitoring, assembly benches, and in vitro experimentation.

The Laboratory of Signal and Image Processing (LAPIS) of the Biomedical Engineering Program at COPPE / UFRJ has a computer network adequate to support the development of the proposed models. UFLA's Data Processing Laboratories have a set of computers and supercomputers for processing complex models developed by the Research Group on Artificial Intelligence and Automation.

The "Biosignal Processing Group" is part of the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland. The institute is focused on the study of computational intelligence applied to several areas of science, such as robotics, biometrics, social interactions, and health. The group has the institutional computing infrastructure, whose backbone is formed by a high-performance data storage system, computers and supercomputers containing state-of-the-art graphics processing cards, connected in a distributed calculation grid. The systems are used for training, validation, and testing of models in computational intelligence.

## Expected results and applicability in SUS 

Among the studies that we have been carrying out, is the ACT study that proposed to understand the barriers of the cascade of care of the home contacts of patients with pulmonary TB and solutions to overcome these barriers. We found, in RJ, Manaus, and Recife, bottlenecks from the identification of contacts to the prescription of treatment. As the initial barriers were overcome, the following steps revealed new ones. Among them, the availability of RxT, often delaying diagnosis and starting treatment by several weeks, even in places where radiology services were available (Bastos, IJTLD, in press). This is due to the necessity to read the exam by a specialist. Consistently, this project proposes the use of innovative technological tools to overcome this barrier. The resulting product - an application for automated reading of RxT in the proposed indication (exclusion of active TB among TPT candidates) - will be patented for eventual commercialization in the private sector and other countries, but it can be implemented in SUS without costs. Today, machine learning allows high-level performance to be achieved in different areas, notably image processing. This technology can be used online, producing a fast response at a low cost. Thus, it is expected to contribute to a specific aspect in the TB care cascade, but with a strong solution impact.

## Scientific, technological and innovation relevance  

The use of applications to aid radiological diagnosis has never been tested for the purpose proposed here (identification of normal images or without signs of active TB) so that in addition to developing a new application for unrestricted use in SUS, it is an original nomination, which may have relevant implications for achieving the goals of sustainable development of WHO and the United Nations high-level meeting.

Due to the originality of the proposal, the methods, the development of the application, and its applications, it is expected to publish at least 6 articles in internationally indexed journals, and to involve undergraduate, master's, doctoral and postdoctoral students, with training in human resources. able to work on multidisciplinary projects.

The application of artificial intelligence in health has proven to be of great scientific relevance, given the numerous published works, with a dizzying growth in recent years. Part of this increase in interest is due to the introduction of *deep learning*, which, with its deep processing models, has proven to be effective in learning even very complex characteristics. In particular, in image processing, deep learning is the state of the art and this technique has been shown to be able to analyze X-ray images, in such a way that its applicability for screening patients in LTB is quite motivating. 

This project combines researchers from the fields of medicine, engineering, and computing, in such a way that these areas can benefit from the results of the project and from the deep learning models developed for screening at ILTB. The innovation of this initiative is latent, with the participation of COPPE / UFRJ, which as a leading engineering institution in Latin America, has an enormous vocation to foster innovation. COPPE has a large number of native companies, maintains a business incubator, and has a strong relationship with the Brazilian industry, in particular with companies located in the University City of Rio de Janeiro and its Technology Park. Also, the project includes researchers in the field of biomedical engineering who are involved in the construction of the NTIEB (Nucleus of Technology and Innovation in Biomedical Engineering), which has been funded by the Ministry of Health and FINEP, intending to foster innovation in the area and generate high-tech startups. In this context, the project leverages innovation activities in biomedical, which can also be taken to our partners in South Africa, in the sense of collaboration between the BRICS. The interdisciplinarity with the health area could not fail to be handled as a strong potential of the project.

## General Impacts and Technology Transfer 

In addition to the advances that are intended in screening for the treatment of LTB, the methods developed in the context of this project may find application in a variety of other domains. ML-based CAD systems are expected to be a key element in overcoming rising health care costs and providing effective support to healthcare professionals in the faster and more accurate diagnosis and referral of an increasing number of patients with related pathologies. the age. Thus, we hope that the ML solutions developed here can motivate new applications and, if translatable to other medical systems, can have an impact in this emerging domain for ML.

The project also makes it possible to strengthen cooperation between the BRICS and has the potential to impact the partnership we have in Latin America. Considering the strong innovation characteristics of the project, this cooperation can produce *spin-offs* of the project, with companies in Brazil, South Africa and Latin America being able to be attracted by the capacity demonstrated by ML in this application and to look for similar applications in health, expanding its field of action. In particular, COPPE / UFRJ demonstrates its capacity to foster the creation of high-tech engineering companies and LPS / UFRJ has produced six companies from its activities over the years. Therefore, the creation of startups and expanding the scope of activities of others already established can be an important aspect of this project. 

Due to the relevance of the Brazilian public health system, measures were taken by the government to reconcile the growing increase in health spending with budgetary constraints. One of them is to encourage innovation in health care, in a context in which the creation of startups has been encouraged. In this scenario, the Center for Technology and Innovation in Biomedical Engineering (NTIEB-Coppe / UFRJ) is being built at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The construction work of NTIEB received financial support from the Ministry of Health and Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP), as well as amendments from the Brazilian Parliament. NTIEB is expected to be fully built later this year. It will include the physical infrastructure of laboratories and state-of-the-art equipment that allow the development of technologically innovative solutions to problems in the health sector.

NTIEB is a strategic investment for Brazil, bringing the concept of integration of the research and applied development center to the medical and biological sciences and technological development. Thus, NTIEB proposes to develop and apply exact science techniques to help in prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, as well as to develop medical-hospital equipment/instrumentation and clinical procedures. The present project can thus contribute to the consolidation of NTIEB in the area of ​​health innovation.

## Concrete Perspectives for International Collaboration 

The joint research involving researchers from Brazil, South Africa, and Canada, represents a way of internationalization, thus expanding the spheres in which the results can impact. Brazilian institutions will be able to benefit from this internationalization, collaborating with important institutes in the world research scenario. This internationalization experience may also be extended to the innovation environment, reaching the actions of NTIEB, as well as COPPE's native companies that interact with LPS/UFRJ. Additionally, partnerships that we have in TB research in Latin America will also be able to take advantage of the project's results and engage in this research network that associates ML and TB. In the area of public health, collaborations with McGill University are consolidated and the collaboration recently taken with the University of Cape Town is expanded.

### Partnerships already established 

The partners participating in this project collaborate most often on a bilateral basis between two institutions, which provides a stable structure to operate in a broader network.

The main researcher is *adjunct professor* at MacGill University and the project intends to establish an exchange of doctoral and postdoctoral students, in addition to including new partners from that institution in the collaboration. She is also a collaborator of the *TB International Center* of this institution, one of the WHO collaborating centers, which facilitates the dissemination of the technologies developed and validated here.

LPS/UFRJ has a strong collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine / UFRJ and the CPT in the area of ​​TB. Besides, LPS/UFRJ collaborates in different projects with UFRJ's biomedical engineering group, in the areas of artificial intelligence and instrumentation, in addition to collaborating with UFLA's automation group in intelligent systems applied in the health area. LPS/UFRJ also recently started a collaboration with IDIAP / Switzerland, in the area of ​​intelligent systems in biomedical.
