<h1>Computer-aided diagnosis for excluding active tuberculosis in contacts of pulmonary tuberculosis patients: breaking the transmission chain<a class="headerlink" href="#computer-aided-diagnosis-for-excluding-active-tuberculosis-in-contacts-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-patients-breaking-the-transmission-chain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Despite being preventable and curable, tuberculosis (TB) is
still the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent in the world.
Different strategies to increase TB detection and completion
of treatment in the last two decades, which comprises a four drug-regimen
for six months, have not allowed attaining the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals targets for TB incidence and mortality decline.
The WHO and the United Nations have now specific targets to eliminate
TB until 2050 (End TB Strategy), and TB preventive treatment (TPT) plays
a strategic role to attain these targets.</p>
<p>Prevention of active TB through the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI)
is a cornerstone for achieving TB elimination. LTBI affects about 25%
of the world population, and those with a high risk of progression to
active TB, such as patients with immunosuppressive conditions or with
recent infection, should be treated. Contacts of patients with active
pulmonary TB are the largest existing population targeted for LTBI
treatment. The United Nations declaration of 2018 recommends treating,
until 2022, 6 million persons living with HIV (PLH), 4 million child
contacts and 20 million adult contacts of active TB patients. This is
not an easy task, because the cascade-of-care of contacts includes
multiple steps, from testing LTBI, exclusion of active TB, and treatment
prescription and adherence. Many losses occur in all steps of this cascade,
and less than 20% of those intended to receive TPT complete treatment. In Brazil,
less than 2% complete TPT.</p>
<p>The step of active TB exclusion is a bottleneck in many low- and medium-income
countries (LMIC), including Brazil. Currently, WHO and the Brazilian
Ministry of Health recommend symptom screening and chest X-rays (CXR).
The risk is so high in PLH and children under 5 years of age that WHO
recommends that in high-burden countries (all LMIC), this step can be
skipped in those two subpopulations. Brazil, however, recommends CXR in
all contacts before TPT can be treated. Unavailability of CXR and the need
for specialists to interpret the results delay or preclude TB exclusion and
the initiation of TPT. Changes in the lung parenchyma due to diseases other
than active TB include sequelae of TB (fibrosis, bronchiectasis, cavities,
calcifications), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cases of
pneumonia, tumors, adenomegalies among others. Several pulmonary images
that appear in patients with COVID-19, which recently reached thousands of
people on the planet and can affect more than half of the population, even
without causing symptoms, can remain as a pulmonary sequel, making the
interpretation of RxT even more difficult. Computer-aided applications have
been developed to overcome this barrier.</p>
<p>This team has been working on strategies to simplify the cascade of care of
contacts and PLH to scale up TPT in LMIC. We have previously worked on a novel
serum-based test to exclude TB, that had a high negative predictive value.
In the current project, we intend to validate one existing application and
develop an application to read CXR of contacts and distinguish (a) normal
patterns; (b) parenchymal lesions non-active TB related and (c) active TB
lesions. The developed application will be available for free-of-charge
incorporation in the Brazilian public health system (SUS). This would allow
the same-day exclusion of active TB and the possibility of TPR prescription.
To this end, we will work with a multidisciplinary team that will include
specialists on TB, public health, and artificial intelligence-specialized engineers.
For machine learning, we will use a normal CXR database, from participants of
two clinical trials of different regimens to treat LTBI, and publicly available
databases of multiple TB and non-TB CXR.</p>
