# Image Service

X-ray Image web service for managing x-ray databases,exporting the TB tagged images for machine learning related activities.

## Requirements
You must have Docker Desktop installed to run this application in your computer.

## Webserver
The image service builds the data base  that will be filled with the data from multiple datasets, and them rearrange and display them to users in a more accessible way.

## Running the Web Service
In your terminal, type the commands bellow to create the database structure. After cloning this repository, via command line, cd into the project root folder and start the containers by running:

``` 
cd dorothy-image-servic/webserver/django
docker-compose up -d
```

After doing that, you must access the container to install an important requirement, the dorothy-data-reader repository. So you must type the following commands:

```
docker exec -it dorothy-image-service_web_1

pip install git+https://github.com/tb-brics/dorothy-data-reader.git
```

And finally, to create your data base models:
```
cd webserver/django
python manage.py migrate
```

## Setting Up The Aplication
Now, exit the container, going back to the regular terminal, still on the dorothy-image-service/webserver/django folder.
Assuming that you have already the datasets downloaded in your computer, follow the steps to load the data and them be able to access it in the API.

1. Copying the datasets to the container:

     ```
     docker cp <local_path> dorothy-image-service_web_1:/imagesrep
     ```

     Example: 
     ```
     docker cp "C:\Users\Desktop\MontgomerySet\" dorothy-image-service_web_1:\imagesrep
     ```
For the curent datasets, Indian, Chinese and Montgomery, the paths should end in IndiaDataSet, ChinaSet_AllFiles or MontgomerySet, which are the usual folder names for those datasets. Depending on the size of the dataset, this might take a few minutes.

2. Enter the image service from inside the container:
     ```
     docker exec -it dorothy-image-service_web_1
     cd webserver/django
     ```
3. Perform the load command:

     ```
     python manage.py load <dataset_name> <container_dataset_path>
     ```

     Example: 
     ```
     python manage.py load montgomery /imagesrep/MontgomerySet
     ```
The container dataset path can be rewritten as /imagesrep/<dataset_folder_name>, as it should always start with "/imagesrep/".
